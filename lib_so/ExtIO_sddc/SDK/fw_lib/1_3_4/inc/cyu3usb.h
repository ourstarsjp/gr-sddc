    \brief The USB device mode driver on the FX3 device is responsible for handling
    USB 3.0 and 2.0 connections, and providing the API hooks for configuring device
    operations.

    \section UsbEnumModes Enumeration Modes
    \brief The FX3 USB driver supports two different modes of enumeration, one of
    which is optimized for good performance and simplified application code; whereas
    the other allows for greater flexibility.

    <B>Description</B>\n
    Two different modes of enumeration control are supported by the USB driver
    on the FX3 device.

    **1. Fast enumeration**: In this case, all of the descriptors for all USB speeds
    of interest are registered with the USB driver through the CyU3PUsbSetDesc
    API call. The USB driver then uses this information to handle all of the
    standard USB setup requests. The driver is responsible for identifying the
    current connection speed and using the appropriate set of USB descriptors.

    In this case, only a single configuration descriptor can be used because
    only one config descriptor for each connection speed can be registered with
    the USB driver. The application will also need to disconnect the USB link
    and re-enumerate every time it wants to change the descriptors.

    **2. User enumeration**: In this case, all USB setup requests are forwarded to the
    user application logic through a callback function. It is the responsibility
    of the application code to handle these requests and to send the appropriate
    responses to the USB host. The application also has to track the current
    USB connection speed and use this to identify the specific descriptor to send
    up to the host.

    In this case, the application can change the descriptor data at will and
    has maximum flexibility in terms of implementing multiple configurations
    and alternate settings.

    <B>Note</B>\n
    In either form of enumeration, any non-standard (Class or vendor specific)
    setup request will trigger a callback function. The user application is
    expected to handle these requests in all cases.

    \section UsbDevFuncs USB Device Mode Functions
    \brief The USB device APIs are used to configure the USB device functionality
    and to perform USB data transfers.

    <B>Description</B>\n
    The FX3 device supports programmable USB peripheral implementation at
    USB-SS, USB-HS and USB-FS speeds. The type of USB device to be implemented as
    well as the endpoint pipes to be used can be configured through a set of USB
    device mode APIs. The USB device mode APIs also provide the capability to
    manage the endpoint states such as STALL and NAK as well as to perform data
    transfers on the control endpoint (EP0). Data transfers on the other USB endpoints
    will be controlled through the DMA APIs.

/** \brief List of USB related events that are raised by the USB manager.

    <B>Description</B>\n
    The USB manager or driver continually runs on a thread on the FX3 device
    and performs the necessary operations to handle various USB requests from
    the host. The USB driver can notify the user application about various USB
    specific events by calling a callback function that is registered with it.
    This type lists the various USB event types that are notified to the
    application logic.

    can result in errors due to the subsequent request being ACKed prematurely.

    The USB 3.0 host may request the FX3 device to switch the USB link to a low power
    state when the host has no more activity to perform. This event callback is raised
    when a request from the host to switch the link to a U1/U2 state is received.

    <B>Description</B>\n
    The DMA channels associated with USB endpoints on the FX3 device can be
    configured to have buffers of any user specified size (up to 64 KB). The FX3
    device will allow multiple packets worth of data to be collected into a
    single DMA buffer as long as all of the packets are full packets. Any short
    packet arriving from USB will cause a DMA buffer to be wrapped up and committed
    to the consumer.

    This API is used to set the maximum packet size that applies to the current
    endpoint. This needs to be set by the application based on the active USB
    connection speed, if there is a need to collect multiple data packets into a
    buffer. By default, this is set to the maximum packet size computed based on
    the user specified CyU3PEpConfig_t.pcktSize value, the USB connection speed and

/** \brief Enable/Disable VBus detection in FX3 firmware.

    <B>Description</B>\n
    When the FX3 device is functioning as a USB device, it performs Vbus detection by default;
    and will connect to the host only when VBus voltage is seen to be above 4.1 V. This API is
    used to configure the FX3 device to ignore the VBus input.
   
    In some cases, the VBus voltage may be connected to the VBatt input of FX3 through a regulator.
    The firmware can be configured to automatically detect the VBatt input and enable/disable the
    USB connectivity accordingly. The useVbatt parameter can be set to select this mode of operation.
   
    If the VBus signal from the USB connector is not connected to FX3 or connected to a GPIO,
    the user is expected to enable/disable the USB connection at appropriate times. In this case;
    both the enable and useVbatt parameters should be set to CyFalse, and the CyU3PConnectState
    API should be called directly by the user application.

    <B>Note</B>\n
    The USB block on the FX3 device draws power from the VBus supply by default. If the voltage source
    connected on the VBus pin is unable to provide enough power for this, the user should use the
    CyU3PUsbVBattEnable API to have the device draw power from VBatt instead.

/** \brief Enable/Disable USB 2.0 device operation on FX3 device.

    <B>Description</B>\n
    By default, the FX3 device is configured to attempt both USB 3.0 and 2.0 connections to a USB
    host. The USB driver in the firmware automatically attempts a hi-speed or full speed connection,
    if the SuperSpeed connection fails to go through link training.

    Some designs may use the FX3 device in USB 3.0 mode alone, and require that an external controller
    be used in USB 2.0 mode. This API can be used to modify the driver behavior to suppress the USB 2.0
    device operation on FX3. USB events are provided to notify the user that the 3.0 connection has
    failed, and a 2.0 connection needs to be attempted. The CyU3PConnectState API should be called

/** \brief Set the number of maximum sized packets that an OUT endpoint buffer can accommodate.

    <B>Description</B>\n
    Some USB endpoints (isochronous or interrupt) may have maximum packet sizes that are not aligned
    to 512 or 1024 bytes. When one such OUT endpoint makes use of DMA buffers that can hold multiple
    packets worth of data, the space availability may not be calculated correctly by the FX3 device.\n

    For example, if there is an ISOCHRONOUS endpoint with maximum packet size of 128 bytes and DMA
    buffers of 384 bytes are used with this endpoint; each buffer can actually accommodate 3 packets
    of data. However, FX3 will calculate this as 2 packets only and may end up dropping the third
    packet if all three packets are received in a single micro-frame.\n

    In such cases, the count of packets that can be accommodated in one DMA buffer can be statically
    programmed by the user. This API allows the user to set this configuration. The value specified
    here should be calculated based on the DMA buffer size and the maximum packet size for the endpoint.
    This should be called once the SET_CONFIGURATION or SET_INTERFACE request that enables the interface
    has been received.

/** \brief Select endpoints that should not be suspended to allow EP0 transfers to complete.

    <B>Description</B>\n
    When FX3 is operating in High Speed mode, other IN endpoints are suspended while any EP0-IN data
    transfers are being handled. This scheme is implemented as a work-around to ensure that no data
    corruption occurs. However, this work-around can affect the on-time data transfer on periodic
    endpoints. This API can be used to specify that some IN endpoints should be exempted from the
    implementation of this suspend work-around.

/** \brief Disable USB 3.0 electrical compliance mode support.

    <B>Description</B>\n
    The USB spec requires USB devices to check for USB 3.0 support on the upstream device/hub by
    checking for a valid termination on the SSTX (far side RX) pins. The spec defines a valid
    termination impedance of under 30 Ohms and an invalid (no USB 3.0 support) termination impedance
    above 25 KOhms.
    
    FX3 has a receiver detection threshold of approximately 150 Ohms, and will enter USB 3.0
    electrical compliance test mode if a host/hub offers impedance under 150 Ohms while USB 3.0
    is disabled. This behavior can be modified by calling this API to disable compliance test
    mode support. If compliance mode is disabled, FX3 will enter USB 2.0 link mode if the Polling.LFPS
    handshake times out.
