;## This is the scatter file for FX3 memory map.
;## The FX3 device has 16 KB of I-TCM memory which can be used for
;## code (typically ISRs) and 512 KB of SYSTEM RAM which is shared
;## between code, data and DMA buffers.

; The default memory map used for FX3 applications is as follows:
;
; Descriptor area   Base: 0x40000000 Size: 12KB
; Code area         Base: 0x40003000 Size: 180KB
; Data area         Base: 0x40030000 Size: 32KB
; Driver heap       Base: 0x40038000 Size: 32KB  (Update cyfxtx.c for changing this.)
; Buffer area       Base: 0x40040000 Size: 224KB (Update cyfxtx.c for changing this.)
; 2-stage boot area Base: 0x40078000 Size: 32 KB (Update cyfxtx.c for changing this.)

; Interrupt handlers to be placed in I-TCM (16KB).

; The first 256 bytes of ITCM are reserved for Exception Vectors.
; These vectors will be loaded to ITCM at address 0x0 as part of
; device initialization.

; Kernel stacks are to be placed in the D-TCM (8KB).
; This is done internal to the library as part of CyU3PFirmwareEntry()
; and is not expected to be modified by the FX3 application.
; SYS_STACK       Base: 0x10000000 Size 2KB    (Used by ISR bottom-halves.)
; ABT_STACK       Base: 0x10000800 Size 256B   (Unused except in error cases.)
; UND_STACK       Base: 0x10000900 Size 256B   (Unused except in error cases.)
; FIQ_STACK       Base: 0x10000A00 Size 512B   (Unused as FIQ is not registered.)
; IRQ_STACK       Base: 0x10000C00 Size 1KB    (Used by IST top halves.)
; SVC_STACK       Base: 0x10001000 Size 4KB    (Used by the RTOS kernel and scheduler.)
